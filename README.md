This was one of my senior projects for my final graphic design porfolio show. I started working with A-Frame back in January 2016 and knew immediately I wanted to use it for my project. Since my focus in my major was on web design, VR in web had always been something on my mind.

So I made this VR portfolio to go along with my normal portfolio website and demonstrated it at our senior graphic design show with a google cardboard.
