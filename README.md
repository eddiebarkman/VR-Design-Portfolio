This was one of my senior projects for my final graphic design porfolio show. I started working with A-Frame back in January 2016 and knew immediately I wanted to use it for my project.

Since my focus in my major was on interactive multimedia and web design, VR for web had always been on my mind. So I made this VR portfolio to go along with my normal portfolio website and demonstrated it at our senior graphic design show with a google cardboard. It was a fun way to introduce my classmates, teachers and some community members to VR on the web!

It was my first time working with javascript but I used it to try to make the page feel super interactive. I used a lot of transitions and animations. It was designed with gaze interaction in mind. I didn't have a google cardboard that clicked at the time plus it made it feel like a newer experience!
